    - Solution:

$$
 20\text{ percent} \text{ of } 150 = 150 \times \frac{20}{100} = 30 
$$
 
2. **Percentage Increase/Decrease**  
  - **Example** : A product price increases from \$200 to \$250. What is the percentage increase? 
    - Solution:

$$
 \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{250 - 200}{200} \right) \times 100 = 25\text{ percent} 
$$
 
3. **Successive Percentage Changes**  
  - **Example** : If a population grows by 10\% in the first year and 20\% in the second year, what is the total percentage increase? 
    - Solution: Use the formula for successive changes:

$$
 \text{Total Change} = a + b + \frac{a \cdot b}{100} 
$$

Here,$$a = 10\text{ percent}$$ and$$b = 20\text{ percent}$$:

$$
 = 10 + 20 + \frac{10 \cdot 20}{100} = 32\text{ percent} 
$$
 
4. **Finding the Original Number**  
  - **Example** : If 40\% of a number is 80, what is the original number? 
    - Solution:

$$
 
2. **Ratio to Percentage Conversion**  
  - **Example** : Convert 3:2 to a percentage. 
    - Solution:
For each part in the ratio:

$$
 \frac{3}{5} \times 100 = 60\text{ percent} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40\text{ percent} 
$$
 
3. **Combining Ratios and Percentage Increases**  
  - **Example** : A mix contains ingredients in the ratio 2:3. If the quantity of the second ingredient is increased by 20\%, what is the new ratio? 
    - Solution:
If initial amounts are $2x$ and $3x$, increasing $3x$ by 20\% gives:

$$
 3x \times 1.2 = 3.6x 
$$

The new ratio is $2x : 3.6x = 5 : 9$.

- **Problem**: An article was purchased for ₹400 and sold for ₹350. Find the loss and loss percentage.
- **Solution**:
  - Loss = $400 - 350 = ₹50$
  - Loss\% = $\left(\frac{50}{400}\right) \times 100 = 12.5\%$

#### **Example 3: Finding Selling Price with Profit\%**
- **Problem**: If the cost price of an item is ₹200 and the shopkeeper wants a profit of 25\%, what should be the selling price?
- **Solution**:
  - SP = $200 \times \left(1 + \frac{25}{100}\right)$
  - SP = $200 \times 1.25 = ₹250$

#### **Example 4: Finding Cost Price with Loss\%**
- **Problem**: If the selling price of an article is ₹180 and there is a 10\% loss, find the cost price.
- **Solution**:
  - CP = $\frac{180}{1 - \frac{10}{100}}$
  - CP = $\frac{180}{0.9} = ₹200$

#### **Example 5: Discount Calculation**
- **Problem**: A shirt is marked at ₹1000 and is sold at a 20\% discount. What is the selling price?
- **Solution**:
  - Discount = $20\$$ of $1000 = ₹200$

# Work And Time

Work and Time problems are essential in aptitude tests and often require logical thinking and application of basic formulas. Here is everything you need to know.

### **1. Key Concepts and Definitions**

- **Work**: The task or job that needs to be completed.
- **Time**: The amount of time taken to complete a task.
- **Efficiency**: The rate at which a person or machine completes a task.

### **2. Important Formulas**

1. **Basic Work Formula**:
   - If a person can complete a job in $n$ days, then the **work done in 1 day** is:

$$
\text{Work done in 1 day} = \frac{1}{n}
$$

2. **Total Work Formula**:
   - Total work is often considered as 1 unit (the whole job).

3. **Work and Time Relationship**:
   - **Work** = **Time** × **Efficiency**

4. **Combined Work Formula**:
   - If two persons $A$ and $B$ can complete a job in $x$ and $y$ days respectively, then working together, they will complete the job in:
 
$$
\text{Time taken} = \frac{xy}{x + y}
$$

5. **Efficiency and Time Relationship**:
   - If a person is $n\%$ more efficient than another person, then the time taken by the efficient person is:

$$
\text{Time taken} = \frac{100}{100 + n} \times \text{Time of less efficient person}
$$

6. **Work Done by Multiple People**:
   - If $A$ can do a job in $m$ days and $B$ can do it in $n$ days, then:

$$
\text{Total work done per day} = \frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{n}
$$

7. **Inverse Proportion**:
   - Work is inversely proportional to time if efficiency is constant:

$$
\text{Work} \propto \frac{1}{\text{Time}}
$$

### **3. Examples of Problems**

#### **Example 1: Basic Work Calculation**
- **Problem**: If a person can complete a task in 10 days, how much of the task is completed in 1 day?
- **Solution**:
  - Work done in 1 day = $\frac{1}{10}$

#### **Example 2: Combined Work**
- **Problem**: $A$ can complete a job in 5 days and $B$ can complete the same job in 10 days. How long will it take for both working together?
- **Solution**:
  - Combined time = $\frac{5 \times 10}{5 + 10} = \frac{50}{15} = 3.33$ days

#### **Example 3: Efficiency Problem**
- **Problem**: $A$ is 25% more efficient than $B$. If $B$ can complete the job in 20 days, how long will it take $A$ to complete the job?
- **Solution**:
  - $A$’s time = $\frac{100}{125} \times 20 = 16$ days

#### **Example 4: Work Done by Multiple People**
- **Problem**: $A$ can do a job in 6 days, $B$ in 8 days, and $C$ in 12 days. How long will it take for all three to complete the job together?
- **Solution**:
  - Work done per day = $\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{4 + 3 + 2}{24} = \frac{9}{24} = \frac{3}{8}$
  - Total time = $\frac{8}{3} = 2.67$ days

#### **Example 5: Work and Wages**
- **Problem**: If 5 people can complete a job in 12 days and are paid ₹600, what is the share of one person?
- **Solution**:
  - Total work = $5 \times 12 = 60$ person-days
  - Work done by 1 person = $\frac{60}{5} = 12$ days
  - Share = $\frac{600}{5} = ₹120$

#### **Example 6: Work with a Delay**
- **Problem**: $A$ can complete a job in 10 days. $B$ joins $A$ after 5 days. Together they complete the job in 2 more days. How long would it take $B$ alone to complete the job?
- **Solution**:
  - Work done by $A$ in 5 days = $\frac{5}{10} = 0.5$
  - Remaining work = $1 - 0.5 = 0.5$
  - $A$ and $B$ complete this 0.5 work in 2 days, so combined efficiency = $\frac{0.5}{2} = 0.25$
  - Efficiency of $A$ = $\frac{1}{10} = 0.1$
  - Efficiency of $B$ = $0.25 - 0.1 = 0.15$
  - Time taken by $B$ alone = $\frac{1}{0.15} = 6.67$ days

#### **Example 7: Pipes and Cisterns Problem**
- **Problem**: A pipe can fill a tank in 12 hours, while a drain can empty it in 20 hours. If both are open, how long will it take to fill the tank?
- **Solution**:
  - Net work done per hour = $\frac{1}{12} - \frac{1}{20} = \frac{5 - 3}{60} = \frac{2}{60} = \frac{1}{30}$
  - Time taken = 30 hours

--

### **4. Practice Problems**

1. $A$ can complete a job in 15 days and $B$ in 20 days. If they work together, how many days will they take?
2. $C$ is 40% more efficient than $D$. If $D$ can finish a task in 25 days, how long will it take $C$ to finish it?
3. $A$ and $B$ together can complete a job in 8 days. If $A$ alone can complete it in 12 days, how long will $B$ take alone?
4. A pipe can fill a tank in 6 hours. Another pipe can fill it in 9 hours. How long will both pipes take together?
5. $A$ can do a job in 10 days, $B$ in 12 days, and $C$ in 15 days. They start working together but $A$ leaves after 3 days. How long will it take for $B$ and $C$ to complete the remaining work?

# Simple And Compund Interest:

Simple and Compound Interest problems are a fundamental part of aptitude tests. Let's dive into all the formulas, concepts, and examples you need.

### **1. Key Concepts and Definitions**

- **Principal (P)**: The initial amount of money borrowed or invested.
- **Rate of Interest (R)**: The percentage of interest charged per time period (usually annually).
- **Time (T)**: The duration for which the money is borrowed or invested.
- **Amount (A)**: The total money after adding interest (Principal + Interest).
- **Interest (I)**: The additional money earned or paid on the principal.

### **2. Simple Interest (SI)**

Simple Interest is calculated on the original principal throughout the entire period.

#### **Formula for Simple Interest**:

$$
\text{SI} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
$$

#### **Formula for Total Amount**:

$$
\text{A} = P + \text{SI}
$$

### **Example Problems on Simple Interest**

#### **Example 1: Basic SI Calculation**
- **Problem**: Find the simple interest on a principal of ₹5000 at a rate of 5% per annum for 3 years.
- **Solution**:

$$
\text{SI} = \frac{5000 \times 5 \times 3}{100} = ₹750
$$

$$
\text{Amount (A)} = 5000 + 750 = ₹5750
$$

#### **Example 2: Finding Principal**
- **Problem**: If the simple interest for 2 years at a rate of 6% per annum is ₹240, find the principal.
- **Solution**:

$$
\text{SI} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
$$

$$
240 = \frac{P \times 6 \times 2}{100}
$$

$$
P = \frac{240 \times 100}{12} = ₹2000
$$

#### **Example 3: Finding Rate of Interest**
- **Problem**: A principal of ₹1500 amounts to ₹1800 in 2 years. Find the rate of interest.
- **Solution**:

$$
\text{SI} = 1800 - 1500 = ₹300
$$

$$
300 = \frac{1500 \times R \times 2}{100}
$$

$$
R = \frac{300 \times 100}{1500 \times 2} = 10\%
$$

---

### **3. Compound Interest (CI)**

Compound Interest is calculated on the principal as well as the accumulated interest from previous periods.

#### **Formula for Compound Interest**:

$$
\text{CI} = P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^{T} - P
$$

#### **Formula for Total Amount**:

$$
\text{A} = P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^{T}
$$

#### **Formula for Compound Interest Compounded $n$ Times per Year**:

$$
\text{A} = P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100n}\right)^{nT}
$$

### **Example Problems on Compound Interest**

#### **Example 1: Basic CI Calculation**
- **Problem**: Calculate the compound interest on ₹4000 at a rate of 10% per annum for 2 years.
- **Solution**:

$$
\text{A} = 4000 \left(1 + \frac{10}{100}\right)^{2}
$$

$$
\text{A} = 4000 \times 1.1 \times 1.1 = 4000 \times 1.21 = ₹4840
$$

$$
\text{CI} = 4840 - 4000 = ₹840
$$

#### **Example 2: Finding Principal in CI**
- **Problem**: The compound interest on a certain principal at 8% per annum for 3 years is ₹520. Find the principal.
- **Solution**:

$$
\text{A} = P \left(1 + \frac{8}{100}\right)^{3}
$$

Let the principal be $P$.

$$
\text{A} - P = 520
$$

Solving for $P$ using trial, approximation, or logarithmic methods can be applied.

#### **Example 3: CI Compounded Semi-Annually**
- **Problem**: Calculate the amount on ₹5000 at 12% per annum for 1 year if the interest is compounded semi-annually.
- **Solution**:

$$
\text{A} = 5000 \left(1 + \frac{12}{2 \times 100}\right)^{2 \times 1}
$$

$$
\text{A} = 5000 \left(1 + \frac{6}{100}\right)^{2}
$$

$$
\text{A} = 5000 \times 1.06 \times 1.06 = ₹5618
$$

$$
\text{CI} = 5618 - 5000 = ₹618
$$

---

### **4. Difference Between Simple Interest and Compound Interest**

For a given principal, rate, and time:

1. **Simple Interest**:
   - Does not change over time; interest remains constant each year.
2. **Compound Interest**:
   - Increases as it is calculated on the principal and accumulated interest.

#### **Formula for Difference (CI - SI)**:

$$
\text{Difference} = P \left(\left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^{T} - 1 - \frac{R \times T}{100}\right)
$$

#### **Example**:
- **Problem**: Calculate the difference between CI and SI for a principal of ₹2000 at a rate of 5% per annum for 2 years.
- **Solution**:

$$
\text{SI} = \frac{2000 \times 5 \times 2}{100} = ₹200
$$
$$
\text{A (CI)} = 2000 \left(1 + \frac{5}{100}\right)^{2} = 2000 \times 1.1025 = ₹2205
$$
$$
\text{CI} = 2205 - 2000 = ₹205
$$
$$
\text{Difference} = 205 - 200 = ₹5
$$

# Geometric Progression Questions:

Here are some **tricky questions** based on Geometric Progression (GP) with detailed solutions that cover different formulas and aspects of GP.

### **Key Formulas for GP**

1. **General Form of GP**:
   - If $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio, the $n$-th term of a GP is:

$$
a_n = a \times r^{n-1}
$$

2. **Sum of First $n$ Terms**:
   - If $|r| < 1$ (common ratio is less than 1):

$$
S_n = a \left(\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}\right)
$$

- If $|r| > 1$ (common ratio is greater than 1):

$$
S_n = a \left(\frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}\right)
$$

3. **Sum of Infinite GP**:
- If $|r| < 1$:

$$
S_{\infty} = \frac{a}{1 - r}
$$

4. **Product of Terms in GP**:
   - The product of $n$ terms in a GP is:

$$
P = a^n \times r^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}
$$

### **Tricky Questions with Solutions**

#### **Question 1: Finding the $n$-th Term**

**Problem**: The third term of a GP is 16, and the sixth term is 128. Find the first term and the common ratio.

**Solution**:

Given:
- $a_3 = 16$
- $a_6 = 128$

We know:

$$
a_3 = a \times r^{2} = 16
$$
$$
a_6 = a \times r^{5} = 128
$$

Dividing these equations:

$$
\frac{a \times r^{5}}{a \times r^{2}} = \frac{128}{16}
$$
$$
r^{3} = 8 \implies r = 2
$$

Substituting $r = 2$ in $a \times r^{2} = 16$:

$$
a \times 4 = 16 \implies a = 4
$$

**Answer**: The first term is $a = 4$ and the common ratio is $r = 2$.

---

#### **Question 2: Sum of First $n$ Terms**

**Problem**: Find the sum of the first 8 terms of a GP where the first term is 3 and the common ratio is $\frac{1}{2}$.

**Solution**:

Given:
- $a = 3$, $r = \frac{1}{2}$, and $n = 8$

Using the formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms:

$$
S_n = a \left(\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}\right)
$$

Substituting the values:

$$
S_8 = 3 \left(\frac{1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^8}{1 - \frac{1}{2}}\right)
$$
$$
S_8 = 3 \left(\frac{1 - \frac{1}{256}}{\frac{1}{2}}\right)
$$
$$
S_8 = 3 \times \left(\frac{255}{256} \times 2\right)
$$
$$
S_8 = 3 \times \frac{255}{128} = \frac{765}{128} = 5.976
$$

**Answer**: The sum of the first 8 terms is approximately $5.976$.

---

#### **Question 3: Sum of an Infinite GP**

**Problem**: An infinite GP has its first term as 10 and the common ratio is $\frac{1}{3}$. Find the sum of this infinite series.

**Solution**:

Given:
- $a = 10$, $r = \frac{1}{3}$

Since $|r| < 1$, we use the formula for the sum of an infinite GP:

$$
S_{\infty} = \frac{a}{1 - r}
$$

Substituting the values:

$$
S_{\infty} = \frac{10}{1 - \frac{1}{3}}
$$
$$
S_{\infty} = \frac{10}{\frac{2}{3}} = 10 \times \frac{3}{2} = 15
$$

**Answer**: The sum of the infinite GP is $15$.

---

#### **Question 4: Product of $n$ Terms of a GP**

**Problem**: The first term of a GP is 5, the common ratio is 3, and there are 4 terms. Find the product of all the terms.

**Solution**:

Given:
- $a = 5$, $r = 3$, $n = 4$

The formula for the product of $n$ terms in a GP is:

$$
P = a^n \times r^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}
$$

Substituting the values:

$$
P = 5^4 \times 3^{\frac{4(3)}{2}}
$$
$$
P = 625 \times 3^6 = 625 \times 729 = 455625
$$

**Answer**: The product of the 4 terms is $455625$.

---

#### **Question 5: Finding the Common Ratio**

**Problem**: The sum of the first 3 terms of a GP is 21, and their product is 216. Find the common ratio.

**Solution**:

Let the first term be $a$ and the common ratio be $r$.

The terms are $a$, $ar$, and $ar^2$.

Given:

$$
a + ar + ar^2 = 21
$$
$$
a \times ar \times ar^2 = 216 \implies a^3 r^3 = 216 \implies (ar)^3 = 216 \implies ar = 6
$$

Substituting $ar = 6$ in $a + ar + ar^2 = 21$:

$$
a + 6 + \frac{6}{a} = 21
$$

Solving this equation, we get $a = 3$ and $r = 2$.

**Answer**: The common ratio is $2$.

---

#### **Question 6: Insertion of Geometric Means**

**Problem**: Insert 3 geometric means between 2 and 162.

**Solution**:

Let the 3 geometric means be $G_1, G_2, G_3$. The sequence is:

$$
2, G_1, G_2, G_3, 162
$$

Since it forms a GP:

$$
162 = 2 \times r^4
$$
$$
r^4 = \frac{162}{2} = 81 \implies r = 3
$$

Now, we find the geometric means:

$$
G_1 = 2 \times 3 = 6, \quad G_2 = 6 \times 3 = 18, \quad G_3 = 18 \times 3 = 54
$$

**Answer**: The 3 geometric means are $6, 18,$ and $54$.

Permutation refers to the arrangement of objects **in a specific order**. The order of arrangement is important.

- **Formula**:
  The number of permutations of $n$ distinct objects taken $r$ at a time:

$$
P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}
$$

  Where $n!$ (n factorial) is the product of all integers from $1$ to $n$:  
  $n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \dots \times 1$.

---

#### **Combination**:
Combination refers to the selection of objects **without considering the order**. The order of selection is irrelevant.

- **Formula**:
  The number of combinations of $n$ distinct objects taken $r$ at a time:

$$
  C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r! \cdot (n - r)!}
$$
