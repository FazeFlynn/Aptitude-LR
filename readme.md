  - **Example** : If a population grows by 10\% in the first year and 20\% in the second year, what is the total percentage increase? 
    - Solution: Use the formula for successive changes:

$$
 \text{Total Change} = a + b + \frac{a \cdot b}{100} 
$$

Here,$$a = 10\text{ percent}$$ and$$b = 20\text{ percent}$$:

$$
 = 10 + 20 + \frac{10 \cdot 20}{100} = 32\text{ percent} 
$$
 
4. **Finding the Original Number**  
  - **Example** : If 40\% of a number is 80, what is the original number?

For each part in the ratio:

$$
 \frac{3}{5} \times 100 = 60\text{ percent} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40\text{ percent} 
$$
 
3. **Combining Ratios and Percentage Increases**  
  - **Example** : A mix contains ingredients in the ratio 2:3. If the quantity of the second ingredient is increased by 20\%, what is the new ratio? 
    - Solution:
If initial amounts are $2x$ and $3x$, increasing $3x$ by 20\% gives:

$$
 3x \times 1.2 = 3.6x 
$$

The new ratio is $2x : 3.6x = 5 : 9$.
