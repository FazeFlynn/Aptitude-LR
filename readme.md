**1. Percentages** **Definition and Formula**  
- **Percentage** : A way to express a number as a fraction of 100.
$$
 \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100 
$$
**Common Percentage Formulas**  
1. **Finding a Percentage of a Number** :$$
 \text{Result} = \text{Number} \times \left( \frac{\text{Percentage}}{100} \right) 
$$
 
2. **Percentage Increase or Decrease** :$$
 \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Original Value}} \right) \times 100 
$$
 
3. **Converting Fractions to Percentages** :$$
 \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Numerator}}{\text{Denominator}} \right) \times 100 
$$
 
4. **Reversing a Percentage** : To find the original number when a percentage is given, rearrange the formula.

**Types of Percentage Questions**  
1. **Finding a Percentage of a Given Value**  
  - **Example** : What is 20% of 150? 
    - Solution:
$$
 20\% \text{ of } 150 = 150 \times \frac{20}{100} = 30 
$$
 
2. **Percentage Increase/Decrease**  
  - **Example** : A product price increases from $200 to $250. What is the percentage increase? 
    - Solution:
$$
 \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{250 - 200}{200} \right) \times 100 = 25\% 
$$
 
3. **Successive Percentage Changes**  
  - **Example** : If a population grows by 10% in the first year and 20% in the second year, what is the total percentage increase? 
    - Solution: Use the formula for successive changes:
$$
 \text{Total Change} = a + b + \frac{a \cdot b}{100} 
$$

Here, $$a = 10\%$$ and $$b = 20\%$$:
$$
 = 10 + 20 + \frac{10 \cdot 20}{100} = 32\% 
$$
 
4. **Finding the Original Number**  
  - **Example** : If 40% of a number is 80, what is the original number? 
    - Solution:
$$
 \text{Original Number} = \frac{80}{0.4} = 200 
$$

**2. Ratios** **Definition and Formula**  
- **Ratio** : A comparison of two quantities by division.
$$
 \text{Ratio of A to B} = A : B = \frac{A}{B} 
$$
**Types of Ratio Questions**  
1. **Simplifying Ratios**  
  - **Example** : Simplify the ratio 15:25. 
    - Solution:
$$
 \frac{15}{25} = \frac{3}{5} \Rightarrow \text{Ratio} = 3 : 5 
$$
 
2. **Ratio to Fraction Conversion**  
  - **Example** : Express the ratio 3:4 as a fraction. 
    - Solution:
$$
 \frac{3}{3 + 4} = \frac{3}{7} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4}{7} 
$$
 
3. **Finding Missing Terms in Ratios**  
  - **Example** : If 3:5 = 9
, find X. 
    - Solution:
$$
 \frac{3}{5} = \frac{9}{X} \Rightarrow X = \frac{9 \cdot 5}{3} = 15 
$$
 
4. **Dividing Amounts by Ratios**  
  - **Example** : Divide $150 into a ratio of 2:3. 
    - Solution: Find the sum of the parts:
$$
 2 + 3 = 5 
$$

Then,
$$
 \text{Amount for 2} = \frac{2}{5} \times 150 = 60 
$$

$$
 \text{Amount for 3} = \frac{3}{5} \times 150 = 90 
$$
 
5. **Comparing Ratios**  
  - **Example** : Are the ratios 2:3 and 4:6 equivalent?
    - Solution:
Simplify 4:6 to get 2:3, so yes, they are equivalent.

**Combined Questions on Percentages and Ratios**  
1. **Percentage as a Ratio**  
  - **Example** : Convert 25% to a ratio. 
    - Solution:
$$
 25\% = \frac{25}{100} = \frac{1}{4} \Rightarrow \text{Ratio} = 1 : 4 
$$
 
2. **Ratio to Percentage Conversion**  
  - **Example** : Convert 3:2 to a percentage. 
    - Solution:
For each part in the ratio:
$$
 \frac{3}{5} \times 100 = 60\% \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40\% 
$$
 
3. **Combining Ratios and Percentage Increases**  
  - **Example** : A mix contains ingredients in the ratio 2:3. If the quantity of the second ingredient is increased by 20%, what is the new ratio? 
    - Solution:
If initial amounts are $$2x$$ and $$3x$$, increasing $$3x$$ by 20% gives:
$$
 3x \times 1.2 = 3.6x 
$$

The new ratio is $$2x : 3.6x = 5 : 9$$.
