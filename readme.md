`A structured approach to build expertise in aptitude, which will help you systematically progress from foundational concepts to advanced problem-solving:`

1. **Basic Foundations**  
- **Arithmetic Basics** : Start with fundamental operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- **Percentages and Ratios** : Understand percentage calculations, ratio and proportion concepts, and their applications.
- **Fractions and Decimals** : Practice converting between fractions and decimals and handling related problems.
- **Number Series** : Recognize patterns in number sequences and learn the basics of series.

2. **Core Aptitude Topics**  
- **Quantitative Aptitude** : 
  - **Speed, Time, and Distance** : Familiarize yourself with problems involving time, speed, distance, and relative speed.
  - **Profit and Loss** : Cover cost price, selling price, profit percentage, and loss percentage.
  - **Simple and Compound Interest** : Practice calculations for both types of interest with different periods and rates.
  - **Work and Time** : Learn to solve problems about combined work rates and work efficiency.
  - **Probability and Permutations/Combinations** : Basic probability theory and combinatorial counting principles.
 
- **Logical Reasoning** : 
  - **Coding-Decoding** : Practice simple coding and decoding patterns.
  - **Blood Relations** : Understand family relationship problems.
  - **Direction Sense** : Work on problems involving directions and orientations.
  - **Syllogisms and Statements** : Practice statement and conclusion-based problems.
  - **Seating Arrangements and Puzzles** : Tackle complex arrangements and logical puzzles to enhance reasoning skills.

3. **Advanced Problem Solving**  
- **Data Interpretation** : Work on tables, bar graphs, line charts, and pie charts for data analysis and interpretation.
- **Algebra and Equations** : Solve simple linear and quadratic equations.
- **Trigonometry and Geometry** : Cover basics of triangles, circles, and angles as applied in aptitude.
- **Advanced Series and Pattern Recognition** : Move on to more complex number series and logical patterns.

4. **Mock Tests and Practice Rounds** 
- Take regular timed practice tests to simulate the exam environment.
- Start with easy-level questions, progress to medium, and then attempt advanced-level questions.

- Analyze each test to identify and work on weak areas.
