**1. Percentages** **Definition and Formula**  
- **Percentage** : A way to express a number as a fraction of 100.

$$
 \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100 
$$

**Common Percentage Formulas**  
1. **Finding a Percentage of a Number** :

$$
\text{Result} = \text{Number} \times \left( \frac{\text{Percentage}}{100} \right) 
$$
 
2. **Percentage Increase or Decrease** :

$$
 \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Original Value}} \right) \times 100 
$$
 
3. **Converting Fractions to Percentages** :

$$
 \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Numerator}}{\text{Denominator}} \right) \times 100 
$$
 
4. **Reversing a Percentage** : To find the original number when a percentage is given, rearrange the formula.


---

**Types of Percentage Questions**  
1. **Finding a Percentage of a Given Value**  
  - **Example** : What is 20\% of 150? 
    - Solution:

$$
 20\text{ percent} \text{ of } 150 = 150 \times \frac{20}{100} = 30 
$$
 
2. **Percentage Increase/Decrease**  
  - **Example** : A product price increases from \$200 to \$250. What is the percentage increase? 
    - Solution:

$$
 \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{250 - 200}{200} \right) \times 100 = 25\text{ percent} 
$$
 
3. **Successive Percentage Changes**  
  - **Example** : If a population grows by 10\% in the first year and 20\% in the second year, what is the total percentage increase? 
    - Solution: Use the formula for successive changes:

$$
 \text{Total Change} = a + b + \frac{a \cdot b}{100} 
$$

Here,$$a = 10\text{ percent}$$ and$$b = 20\text{ percent}$$:

$$
 = 10 + 20 + \frac{10 \cdot 20}{100} = 32\text{ percent} 
$$
 
4. **Finding the Original Number**  
  - **Example** : If 40\% of a number is 80, what is the original number? 
    - Solution:

$$
 \text{Original Number} = \frac{80}{0.4} = 200 
$$

**2. Ratios** **Definition and Formula**  
- **Ratio** : A comparison of two quantities by division.

$$

**Types of Ratio Questions**  
1. **Simplifying Ratios**  
  - **Example** : Simplify the ratio 15:25. 
    - Solution:

$$
 \frac{15}{25} = \frac{3}{5} \Rightarrow \text{Ratio} = 3 : 5 
$$
 
2. **Ratio to Fraction Conversion**  
  - **Example** : Express the ratio 3:4 as a fraction. 
    - Solution:

$$
 \frac{3}{3 + 4} = \frac{3}{7} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4}{7} 
$$
 
3. **Finding Missing Terms in Ratios**  
  - **Example** : If 3:5 = 9
, find X. 
    - Solution:

$$
 \frac{3}{5} = \frac{9}{X} \Rightarrow X = \frac{9 \cdot 5}{3} = 15 
$$
 
4. **Dividing Amounts by Ratios**  
  - **Example** : Divide $150 into a ratio of 2:3. 
    - Solution: Find the sum of the parts:

$$
 2 + 3 = 5 
$$

Then,

$$
 \text{Amount for 2} = \frac{2}{5} \times 150 = 60 
$$

$$
 \text{Amount for 3} = \frac{3}{5} \times 150 = 90 
$$
 
5. **Comparing Ratios**  
  - **Example** : Are the ratios 2:3 and 4:6 equivalent?
    - Solution:
Simplify 4:6 to get 2:3, so yes, they are equivalent.


---

**Combined Questions on Percentages and Ratios**  
1. **Percentage as a Ratio**  
  - **Example** : Convert 25\% to a ratio. 
    - Solution:

$$
 25\text{ percent} = \frac{25}{100} = \frac{1}{4} \Rightarrow \text{Ratio} = 1 : 4 
$$
 
2. **Ratio to Percentage Conversion**  
  - **Example** : Convert 3:2 to a percentage. 
    - Solution:
For each part in the ratio:

$$
 \frac{3}{5} \times 100 = 60\text{ percent} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40\text{ percent} 
$$
 
3. **Combining Ratios and Percentage Increases**  
  - **Example** : A mix contains ingredients in the ratio 2:3. If the quantity of the second ingredient is increased by 20\%, what is the new ratio? 
    - Solution:
If initial amounts are $2x$ and $3x$, increasing $3x$ by 20\% gives:

$$
 3x \times 1.2 = 3.6x 
$$

The new ratio is $2x : 3.6x = 5 : 9$.

# **1. Fractions**

### **Definition and Types**
- **Fraction**: A fraction represents a part of a whole and is expressed as:

$$
\text{Fraction} = \frac{\text{Numerator}}{\text{Denominator}}
$$

  - **Proper Fraction**: Numerator < Denominator (e.g., $\frac{3}{4}$)
  - **Improper Fraction**: Numerator â‰¥ Denominator (e.g., $\frac{7}{5}$)
  - **Mixed Fraction**: Combination of a whole number and a proper fraction (e.g., $2\frac{1}{3}$)

### **Basic Operations with Fractions**
1. **Addition and Subtraction**:  
   To add or subtract fractions, make the denominators equal.
   - **Example**: $\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6}$
     - Solution:

$$
\text{LCM of 3 and 6 is 6} \Rightarrow \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

2. **Multiplication**:
   Multiply the numerators and denominators directly.
   - **Example**: $\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{3}{4}$
     - Solution:
     
$$
\frac{2 \times 3}{5 \times 4} = \frac{6}{20} = \frac{3}{10}
$$

3. **Division**:

   - **Example**: Which is larger: $\frac{5}{6}$ or $\frac{7}{9}$?
     - Solution: Find a common denominator (18):

$$
\frac{5 \times 3}{6 \times 3} = \frac{15}{18}, \quad \frac{7 \times 2}{9 \times 2} = \frac{14}{18}
$$

       Hence, $\frac{5}{6}$ is larger.

3. **Fraction of a Quantity**:

# Profit And Loss:

Solving profit and loss problems:

- **Cost Price (CP)**: The price at which an article is purchased.
- **Selling Price (SP)**: The price at which an article is sold.
- **Profit (Gain)**: If the Selling Price (SP) is greater than the Cost Price (CP).
  - **Formula**:

$$
\text{Profit} = \text{SP} - \text{CP}
$$

- **Loss**: If the Selling Price (SP) is less than the Cost Price (CP).
  - **Formula**:

$$
\text{Loss} = \text{CP} - \text{SP}
$$

- **Profit Percentage (Profit\%)**:

$$
\text{Profit\%} = \left(\frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{CP}}\right) \times 100
$$

- **Loss Percentage (Loss\%)**:

$$
\text{Loss\%} = \left(\frac{\text{Loss}}{\text{CP}}\right) \times 100
$$

- **Selling Price (SP) when Profit\% is given**:

$$
\text{SP} = \text{CP} \times \left(1 + \frac{\text{Profit\%}}{100}\right)
$$

- **Selling Price (SP) when Loss\% is given**:

$$
\text{SP} = \text{CP} \times \left(1 - \frac{\text{Loss\%}}{100}\right)
$$

- **Cost Price (CP) when Profit\% is given**:

$$
\text{CP} = \frac{\text{SP}}{1 + \frac{\text{Profit\%}}{100}}
$$

- **Cost Price (CP) when Loss\% is given**:

### **4. Example Problems**

#### **Example 1: Basic Profit Calculation**
- **Problem**: A shopkeeper bought an item for â‚¹500 and sold it for â‚¹600. Find the profit and profit percentage.
- **Solution**:
  - Profit = $600 - 500 = â‚¹100$
  - Profit\% = $\left(\frac{100}{500}\right) \times 100 = 20\%$

#### **Example 2: Basic Loss Calculation**
- **Problem**: An article was purchased for â‚¹400 and sold for â‚¹350. Find the loss and loss percentage.
- **Solution**:
  - Loss = $400 - 350 = â‚¹50$
  - Loss\% = $\left(\frac{50}{400}\right) \times 100 = 12.5\%$

#### **Example 3: Finding Selling Price with Profit\%**
- **Problem**: If the cost price of an item is â‚¹200 and the shopkeeper wants a profit of 25\%, what should be the selling price?
- **Solution**:
  - SP = $200 \times \left(1 + \frac{25}{100}\right)$
  - SP = $200 \times 1.25 = â‚¹250$

#### **Example 4: Finding Cost Price with Loss\%**
- **Problem**: If the selling price of an article is â‚¹180 and there is a 10\% loss, find the cost price.
- **Solution**:
  - CP = $\frac{180}{1 - \frac{10}{100}}$
  - CP = $\frac{180}{0.9} = â‚¹200$

#### **Example 5: Discount Calculation**
- **Problem**: A shirt is marked at â‚¹1000 and is sold at a 20\% discount. What is the selling price?
- **Solution**:
  - Discount = $20\$$ of $1000 = â‚¹200$
  - SP = $1000 - 200 = â‚¹800$

#### **Example 6: Marked Price Problem**
- **Problem**: A product is sold for â‚¹720 after a discount of 10\%. Find the marked price.
- **Solution**:
  - MP = $\frac{720}{1 - \frac{10}{100}}$
  - MP = $\frac{720}{0.9} = â‚¹800$

#### **Example 7: Successive Discounts**
- **Problem**: A product is marked at â‚¹2000. Two successive discounts of 10\% and 15\% are given. Find the final selling price.
- **Solution**:
  - After first discount: $SP_1 = 2000 \times (1 - \frac{10}{100}) = â‚¹1800$
  - After second discount: $SP_2 = 1800 \times (1 - \frac{15}{100}) = â‚¹1530$
  - Final Selling Price = â‚¹1530

#### **Example 8: Profit and Loss Together**
- **Problem**: A trader buys a watch for â‚¹1200, spends â‚¹100 on repairs, and sells it for â‚¹1500. Find the profit or loss percentage.
- **Solution**:
  - Total Cost Price (CP) = $1200 + 100 = â‚¹1300$
  - Selling Price (SP) = â‚¹1500
  - Profit = $1500 - 1300 = â‚¹200$
  - Profit\% = $\left(\frac{200}{1300}\right) \times 100 = 15.38\$$
