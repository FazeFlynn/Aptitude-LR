**1. Percentages** **Definition and Formula**  
- **Percentage** : A way to express a number as a fraction of 100.

$$
 \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100 
$$

**Common Percentage Formulas**  
1. **Finding a Percentage of a Number** :

$$
\text{Result} = \text{Number} \times \left( \frac{\text{Percentage}}{100} \right) 
$$
 
2. **Percentage Increase or Decrease** :

$$
 \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Original Value}} \right) \times 100 
$$
 
3. **Converting Fractions to Percentages** :

$$
 \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Numerator}}{\text{Denominator}} \right) \times 100 
$$
 
4. **Reversing a Percentage** : To find the original number when a percentage is given, rearrange the formula.

**Types of Percentage Questions**  
1. **Finding a Percentage of a Given Value**  
  - **Example** : What is 20% of 150? 
    - Solution:

$$
 20\text{ percent} \text{ of } 150 = 150 \times \frac{20}{100} = 30 
$$
 
2. **Percentage Increase/Decrease**  
  - **Example** : A product price increases from \$200 to \$250. What is the percentage increase? 
    - Solution:

$$
 \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{250 - 200}{200} \right) \times 100 = 25\text{ percent} 
$$
 
3. **Successive Percentage Changes**  
  - **Example** : If a population grows by 10% in the first year and 20% in the second year, what is the total percentage increase? 
    - Solution: Use the formula for successive changes:

$$
 \text{Total Change} = a + b + \frac{a \cdot b}{100} 
$$

Here, $$a = 10\text{ percent}$$ and $$b = 20\text{ percent}$$:

$$
 = 10 + 20 + \frac{10 \cdot 20}{100} = 32\text{ percent} 
$$
 
4. **Finding the Original Number**  
  - **Example** : If 40% of a number is 80, what is the original number? 
    - Solution:

$$
 \text{Original Number} = \frac{80}{0.4} = 200 
$$

**2. Ratios** **Definition and Formula**  
- **Ratio** : A comparison of two quantities by division.

$$
 \text{Ratio of A to B} = A : B = \frac{A}{B} 
$$

**Types of Ratio Questions**  
1. **Simplifying Ratios**  
  - **Example** : Simplify the ratio 15:25. 
    - Solution:

$$
 \frac{15}{25} = \frac{3}{5} \Rightarrow \text{Ratio} = 3 : 5 
$$
 
2. **Ratio to Fraction Conversion**  
  - **Example** : Express the ratio 3:4 as a fraction. 
    - Solution:

$$
 \frac{3}{3 + 4} = \frac{3}{7} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4}{7} 
$$
 
3. **Finding Missing Terms in Ratios**  
  - **Example** : If 3:5 = 9
, find X. 
    - Solution:

$$
 \frac{3}{5} = \frac{9}{X} \Rightarrow X = \frac{9 \cdot 5}{3} = 15 
$$
 
4. **Dividing Amounts by Ratios**  
  - **Example** : Divide $150 into a ratio of 2:3. 
    - Solution: Find the sum of the parts:

$$
 2 + 3 = 5 
$$

Then,

$$
 \text{Amount for 2} = \frac{2}{5} \times 150 = 60 
$$

$$
 \text{Amount for 3} = \frac{3}{5} \times 150 = 90 
$$
 
5. **Comparing Ratios**  
  - **Example** : Are the ratios 2:3 and 4:6 equivalent?
    - Solution:
Simplify 4:6 to get 2:3, so yes, they are equivalent.

**Combined Questions on Percentages and Ratios**  
1. **Percentage as a Ratio**  
  - **Example** : Convert 25% to a ratio. 
    - Solution:

$$
 25\text{ percent} = \frac{25}{100} = \frac{1}{4} \Rightarrow \text{Ratio} = 1 : 4 
$$
 
2. **Ratio to Percentage Conversion**  
  - **Example** : Convert 3:2 to a percentage. 
    - Solution:
For each part in the ratio:

$$
 \frac{3}{5} \times 100 = 60\text{ percent} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40\text{ percent} 
$$
 
3. **Combining Ratios and Percentage Increases**  
  - **Example** : A mix contains ingredients in the ratio 2:3. If the quantity of the second ingredient is increased by 20%, what is the new ratio? 
    - Solution:
If initial amounts are $2x$ and $3x$, increasing $3x$ by 20% gives:

$$
 3x \times 1.2 = 3.6x 
$$

The new ratio is $2x : 3.6x = 5 : 9$.

# **1. Fractions**

### **Definition and Types**
- **Fraction**: A fraction represents a part of a whole and is expressed as:

$$
\text{Fraction} = \frac{\text{Numerator}}{\text{Denominator}}
$$

  - **Proper Fraction**: Numerator < Denominator (e.g., $\frac{3}{4}$)
  - **Improper Fraction**: Numerator â‰¥ Denominator (e.g., $\frac{7}{5}$)
  - **Mixed Fraction**: Combination of a whole number and a proper fraction (e.g., $2\frac{1}{3}$)

### **Basic Operations with Fractions**
1. **Addition and Subtraction**:  
   To add or subtract fractions, make the denominators equal.
   - **Example**: $\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6}$
     - Solution:

$$
\text{LCM of 3 and 6 is 6} \Rightarrow \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

2. **Multiplication**:
   Multiply the numerators and denominators directly.
   - **Example**: $\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{3}{4}$
     - Solution:
     
$$
\frac{2 \times 3}{5 \times 4} = \frac{6}{20} = \frac{3}{10}
$$

3. **Division**:
   Multiply by the reciprocal of the second fraction.
   - **Example**: $\frac{3}{7} \div \frac{2}{5}$
     - Solution:

$$
\frac{3}{7} \times \frac{5}{2} = \frac{15}{14}
$$

4. **Converting Mixed Fractions to Improper Fractions**:
   - **Example**: Convert $3\frac{2}{5}$ to an improper fraction.
     - Solution:

$$
3\frac{2}{5} = \frac{3 \times 5 + 2}{5} = \frac{17}{5}
$$

### **Types of Fraction Questions**
1. **Simplifying Fractions**:
   - **Example**: Simplify $\frac{36}{48}$.
     - Solution:

$$
\frac{36 \div 12}{48 \div 12} = \frac{3}{4}
$$

2. **Comparing Fractions**:
   - **Example**: Which is larger: $\frac{5}{6}$ or $\frac{7}{9}$?
     - Solution: Find a common denominator (18):

$$
\frac{5 \times 3}{6 \times 3} = \frac{15}{18}, \quad \frac{7 \times 2}{9 \times 2} = \frac{14}{18}
$$

       Hence, $\frac{5}{6}$ is larger.

3. **Fraction of a Quantity**:
   - **Example**: What is $\frac{2}{3}$ of 90?
     - Solution:
     
$$
90 \times \frac{2}{3} = 60
$$

## **2. Decimals**

### **Definition and Types**
- **Decimal**: A number expressed in the base-10 system, using a decimal point (e.g., 0.5, 3.14).
  - **Terminating Decimal**: Finite number of decimal places (e.g., 0.75).
  - **Non-Terminating, Repeating Decimal**: Infinite decimal places but a repeating pattern (e.g., 0.333...).
  - **Non-Terminating, Non-Repeating Decimal**: Infinite decimal places without a pattern (e.g., $\pi = 3.14159...$).

### **Basic Operations with Decimals**
1. **Addition and Subtraction**:
   Align the decimal points before performing the operation.
   - **Example**: $3.25 + 1.7$
     - Solution:
     
$$
3.25 + 1.70 = 4.95
$$

2. **Multiplication**:
   Ignore the decimal points, multiply the numbers, and place the decimal point in the result.
   - **Example**: $1.2 \times 0.5$
     - Solution:

$$
12 \times 5 = 60 \Rightarrow 1.2 \times 0.5 = 0.60
$$

3. **Division**:
   Move the decimal point to make the divisor a whole number, then divide.
   - **Example**: $3.6 \div 1.2$
     - Solution:

$$
\frac{36}{12} = 3
$$

4. **Converting Fractions to Decimals**:
   Divide the numerator by the denominator.
   - **Example**: Convert $\frac{3}{4}$ to a decimal.
     - Solution:

$$
3 \div 4 = 0.75
$$

5. **Converting Decimals to Fractions**:
   Write the decimal as a fraction and simplify.
   - **Example**: Convert 0.125 to a fraction.
     - Solution:

$$
0.125 = \frac{125}{1000} = \frac{1}{8}
$$
