    - Solution:

$$
 20\text{ percent} \text{ of } 150 = 150 \times \frac{20}{100} = 30 
$$
 
2. **Percentage Increase/Decrease**  
  - **Example** : A product price increases from \$200 to \$250. What is the percentage increase? 
    - Solution:

$$
 \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{250 - 200}{200} \right) \times 100 = 25\text{ percent} 
$$
 
3. **Successive Percentage Changes**  
  - **Example** : If a population grows by 10\% in the first year and 20\% in the second year, what is the total percentage increase? 
    - Solution: Use the formula for successive changes:

$$
 \text{Total Change} = a + b + \frac{a \cdot b}{100} 
$$

Here,$$a = 10\text{ percent}$$ and$$b = 20\text{ percent}$$:

$$
 = 10 + 20 + \frac{10 \cdot 20}{100} = 32\text{ percent} 
$$
 
4. **Finding the Original Number**  
  - **Example** : If 40\% of a number is 80, what is the original number?

$$
 
2. **Ratio to Percentage Conversion**  
  - **Example** : Convert 3:2 to a percentage. 
    - Solution:
For each part in the ratio:

$$
 \frac{3}{5} \times 100 = 60\text{ percent} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40\text{ percent} 
$$
 
3. **Combining Ratios and Percentage Increases**  
  - **Example** : A mix contains ingredients in the ratio 2:3. If the quantity of the second ingredient is increased by 20\%, what is the new ratio? 
    - Solution:
If initial amounts are $2x$ and $3x$, increasing $3x$ by 20\% gives:

$$
 3x \times 1.2 = 3.6x 
$$

The new ratio is $2x : 3.6x = 5 : 9$.

$$
\text{Time taken} = \frac{xy}{x + y}
$$

5. **Efficiency and Time Relationship**:
   - If a person is $n\%$ more efficient than another person, then the time taken by the efficient person is:

$$
\text{Time taken} = \frac{100}{100 + n} \times \text{Time of less efficient person}
$$

6. **Work Done by Multiple People**:
   - If $A$ can do a job in $m$ days and $B$ can do it in $n$ days, then:

$$
\text{Total work done per day} = \frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{n}
$$

7. **Inverse Proportion**:
   - Work is inversely proportional to time if efficiency is constant:

$$
\text{Work} \propto \frac{1}{\text{Time}}
$$

### **3. Examples of Problems**

#### **Example 1: Basic Work Calculation**
- **Problem**: If a person can complete a task in 10 days, how much of the task is completed in 1 day?
- **Solution**:
  - Work done in 1 day = $\frac{1}{10}$

#### **Example 2: Combined Work**
- **Problem**: $A$ can complete a job in 5 days and $B$ can complete the same job in 10 days. How long will it take for both working together?
- **Solution**:
  - Combined time = $\frac{5 \times 10}{5 + 10} = \frac{50}{15} = 3.33$ days

#### **Example 3: Efficiency Problem**
- **Problem**: $A$ is 25% more efficient than $B$. If $B$ can complete the job in 20 days, how long will it take $A$ to complete the job?
- **Solution**:
  - $A$’s time = $\frac{100}{125} \times 20 = 16$ days

#### **Example 4: Work Done by Multiple People**
- **Problem**: $A$ can do a job in 6 days, $B$ in 8 days, and $C$ in 12 days. How long will it take for all three to complete the job together?
- **Solution**:
  - Work done per day = $\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{4 + 3 + 2}{24} = \frac{9}{24} = \frac{3}{8}$
  - Total time = $\frac{8}{3} = 2.67$ days

#### **Example 5: Work and Wages**
- **Problem**: If 5 people can complete a job in 12 days and are paid ₹600, what is the share of one person?
- **Solution**:
  - Total work = $5 \times 12 = 60$ person-days
  - Work done by 1 person = $\frac{60}{5} = 12$ days
  - Share = $\frac{600}{5} = ₹120$

#### **Example 6: Work with a Delay**
- **Problem**: $A$ can complete a job in 10 days. $B$ joins $A$ after 5 days. Together they complete the job in 2 more days. How long would it take $B$ alone to complete the job?
- **Solution**:
  - Work done by $A$ in 5 days = $\frac{5}{10} = 0.5$
  - Remaining work = $1 - 0.5 = 0.5$
  - $A$ and $B$ complete this 0.5 work in 2 days, so combined efficiency = $\frac{0.5}{2} = 0.25$
  - Efficiency of $A$ = $\frac{1}{10} = 0.1$
  - Efficiency of $B$ = $0.25 - 0.1 = 0.15$
  - Time taken by $B$ alone = $\frac{1}{0.15} = 6.67$ days

#### **Example 7: Pipes and Cisterns Problem**
- **Problem**: A pipe can fill a tank in 12 hours, while a drain can empty it in 20 hours. If both are open, how long will it take to fill the tank?
- **Solution**:
  - Net work done per hour = $\frac{1}{12} - \frac{1}{20} = \frac{5 - 3}{60} = \frac{2}{60} = \frac{1}{30}$
  - Time taken = 30 hours

### **4. Practice Problems**

1. $A$ can complete a job in 15 days and $B$ in 20 days. If they work together, how many days will they take?
2. $C$ is 40% more efficient than $D$. If $D$ can finish a task in 25 days, how long will it take $C$ to finish it?
3. $A$ and $B$ together can complete a job in 8 days. If $A$ alone can complete it in 12 days, how long will $B$ take alone?
4. A pipe can fill a tank in 6 hours. Another pipe can fill it in 9 hours. How long will both pipes take together?
5. $A$ can do a job in 10 days, $B$ in 12 days, and $C$ in 15 days. They start working together but $A$ leaves after 3 days. How long will it take for $B$ and $C$ to complete the remaining work?
